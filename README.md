# atariGame1979

<h5>
Hereâ€™s a throwback for ya, this game is a copycat to the 1979 Atari Asteriods game. 
</h5>
  
  
<h5>
The goal of the game is to simply survive for as long as you can while blowing up as many floating space rocks around you and earning some points. When an asteroid is destroyed, it will be broken into smaller pieces that are much harder to hit and avoid.
